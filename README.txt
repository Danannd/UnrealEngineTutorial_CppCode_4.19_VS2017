This code is Unreal Engine Tutorial Code from
https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Programming

The original Tutorial is based on UE4.9 but the newest is
UE4.19, so if you learn the tutorial from website, it will
have a lot of problem and compile failed because the tutorial
from docs.unrealengine.com are older and not have a #include
in the code, so these code is based on UE4.19 and Visual Studio2017
can help you to learn UE4 easily.

The files name is same as the tutorial from docs.unrealengine.com

In addition, I also rewrite a little code such as:
USceneComponent::AttachTo() -> USceneComponent::AttachToComponent()
because the first was deprecated after UE4.12

I will update all of the code in these days.

Other question please:

Best wish to you code HAPPY!
